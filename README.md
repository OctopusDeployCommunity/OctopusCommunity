# OctopusCommunity

The community is a place for open, meaningful discussions and hot topics in the world of DevOps. Members of the community can help produce informative and educational content, alongside any tips and tricks. This should be a fun place where the community can share ideas, help each other, and grow together. It will also enable Octopus to broaden our reach so that our tools help more people across the world, including those new to DevOps.
